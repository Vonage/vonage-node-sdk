## Installation

### With NPM

```bash
npm install @vonage/server-sdk
```

### With Yarn

```bash
yarn add @vonage/server-sdk
```

## Constructor

```js
const { Vonage } = require('@vonage/server-sdk');

const vonage = new Vonage(credentials, options);
```

Where `credentials` is any option from [`@vonage/auth`](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-node-sdk/blob/3.x/packages/auth/README.md#options), and `options` is any option from [`@vonage/server-client`](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-node-sdk/blob/3.x/packages/server-client/README.md#options)

## Promises

Most methods that interact with the Vonage API uses Promises. You can either resolve these yourself, or use `await` to wait for a response.

```js
const resp = await vonage.sms.send({
    to: '15552220000',
    from: '15559992222',
    text: 'This is a test',
});
```

## Testing

Run:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or to continually watch and run tests as you change the code:

```bash
npm run test-watch
```

## Examples

See the [Vonage Node Quickstarts repo](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-node-code-snippets).
